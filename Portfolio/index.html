          <h2>About Kevin</h2>
          <p>
            My journey to become a Software Engineer is a little different than
            most. I have a bachelors of science from Virginia Tech in Human
            Nutrition, Foods, and Exercise. When I first started I dove
            headfirst into manual QA testing at Agile Onboarding and learning
            from Code Academy and multiple other sources. I slowly started to
            pick up coding and didn't start to make major strides until I was
            introduced to Cypress testing. <br />
            Cypress testing was a game changing experience. When working in
            cypress you dive deep into the code to pick what object you are
            looking to test. You also learn how different attributes of the code
            can impact how objects interact. I am not enrolled in KodeDen to
            dive deeper into Software Development and truly become a full stack
            developer to be the best asset to my team at Agile Onboarding.
