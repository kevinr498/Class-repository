        <h4>Poodle</h4>
        <p>
          Poodles are regarded as one of the most intelligent breeds in the
          world. They’re highly trainable and well suited for just about any
          task you put them to — and you will want to give them tasks to do.
          Bored Poodles can get destructive if they aren’t physically and
          mentally stimulated. But active owners who can meet their dog’s needs
          will find a loving, smart, trainable, and loyal family companion.

        <h4>Pitbull</h4>
        <p>
          The American Pit Bull Terrier is a companion and family dog breed.
          Originally bred to “bait” bulls, the breed evolved into all-around
          farm dogs, and later moved into the house to become “nanny dogs”
          because they were so gentle around children.

        <h4>Belgian Malinois</h4>
        <p>
          In the hands of an experienced dog person, these canines are intense,
          intelligent, and athletic companions. However, with their high energy
          and exercise needs, they may not fair as well in apartments or small
          living spaces. This breed is not likely to suit a first-time dog
          owner. But with firm, consistent training and plenty of physical and
          mental activity, these pups will be loving and loyal for life.

        <h4>German Sheperd</h4>
        <p>
          The German Shepherd Dog is one of America’s most popular dog breeds —
          for good reasons. They’re intelligent and capable working dogs. Their
          devotion and courage are unmatched. And they’re amazingly versatile.
          GSDs excel at most anything they’re trained to do: guide and
          assistance work for the handicapped, police and military service,
          herding, search and rescue, drug detection, competitive obedience, and
          — last but not least — faithful companion.

        <h4>Doberman Pinscher</h4>
        <p>
          Doberman Pinschers originated in Germany during the late 19th century,
          mostly bred as guard dogs. Their exact ancestry is unknown, but
          they’re believed to be a mixture of many dog breeds, including the
          Rottweiler, Black and Tan Terrier, and German Pinscher. With their
          sleek coat, athletic build, and regal appearance, this pup looks like
          an aristocrat. They’re highly energetic and smart dogs who perform
          well in police and military work, canine sports, and as family
          guardians and companions.

        <h4>Hound Dog</h4>
        <p>
          Adaptable, affectionate, and relaxed, these dogs will even appeal to
          novice pet parents who are new to the dog world. You will, however,
          need to commit to at least moderate exercise and feed your pup an
          appropriate diet, as their easygoing demeanor could lead to weight
          gain and the health issues that can come with. If you can keep your
          Basset active, in spite of how much they may protest, you’ll have a
          loving companion who will stick around for many years to come.
